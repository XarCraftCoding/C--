# C-- (CPP Compiler)

This repository contains the source code of my new programming language called C--.
It is called C-- because it's simple and coded in C++. ðŸ”¥

This compiler is written in C++ but hopefully it will get to a point where it can be self-hosted.

## Building

> Requires `nasm` and `ld` on a Linux operating system or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XarCraftCoding/C--
cd C--
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Executable will be `c--` in the `build/` directory.
